Comprehensive HTML to Markdown Conversion Prompt
Task Description
Convert the provided HTML content into Markdown format while preserving all information, structure, and semantic meaning. The conversion must be complete and exact, with no loss of information or context.
Requirements
Content Preservation

Convert ALL text content present in the HTML
Preserve exact wording, including punctuation and spacing
Maintain the hierarchical structure of the document
Keep all bullet points, numbered lists, and other organizational elements
Retain emphasis (bold, italic, underline, etc.)
Convert tables completely with proper markdown table syntax
Include all links and their exact destinations
Preserve code blocks with appropriate formatting and syntax highlighting hints

Structure Handling

Maintain the exact heading structure (H1, H2, H3, etc. but obviously with #, ##, ###)
Preserve nested structures (divs, sections, etc.) using appropriate markdown indentation
Convert nested lists with proper indentation levels
Maintain document flow and semantic grouping of content

Special Elements

Convert images to markdown format with alt text and source URLs
Handle blockquotes with proper markdown syntax
Format code blocks with language specification when available
Convert special characters and HTML entities to appropriate markdown equivalents
Preserve horizontal rules/dividers
Handle form elements by describing their structure and purpose in markdown
Convert buttons with descriptive text
Include descriptions of interactive elements that cannot be directly represented in markdown

Technical Fidelity

For tables, maintain header rows, alignment, and cell content exactly
For complex layouts (like multi-column designs), use appropriate markdown techniques to preserve the logical structure
For SVG or canvas elements, provide a text description and/or link to the original resource
For embedded media (audio, video), include links and descriptions
For CSS styling that affects meaning, describe the visual presentation in brackets if necessary

Approach Instructions

First analyze the complete HTML structure to understand the document hierarchy
Process the HTML systematically, element by element, starting with the main document structure
For each HTML element, identify the most appropriate markdown equivalent
Maintain exact hierarchical relationships between elements
Preserve all textual content without omission
If an HTML element cannot be directly represented in markdown, provide a clear text description of its purpose and content
Verify that all links, references, and cross-references are maintained
Ensure that the logical flow and organization of the document remains intact
Double-check that no information or content has been lost in the conversion process

Output Format
The output should be valid, well-formatted markdown that:

Uses proper heading levels (# for H1, ## for H2, etc.)
Formats links as text
Presents images as Show Image
Uses proper list formatting (- or * for bullets, 1. for numbered lists)
Formats tables with proper column alignment indicators
Uses ``` for code blocks with language specification
Uses > for blockquotes
Uses text for bold, text for italic, and text for inline code
Uses --- for horizontal rules
Implements proper indentation for nested structures

Special Instructions

If you encounter HTML components that don't have direct markdown equivalents (like complex forms or interactive elements), describe them clearly in brackets: [Form element: input field for email with placeholder "Enter your email"]
For data visualizations or complex media, provide a brief description and link to the original resource
For tables with merged cells or complex structures, maintain the logical organization even if visual alignment must be adapted
If the HTML contains crucial styling that affects meaning, note this in the markdown conversion

Verification Process
After completing the conversion:

Verify that ALL text content from the HTML is present in the markdown
Confirm that all hyperlinks are preserved with correct URLs
Check that all lists, tables, and structured content maintain their organization
Ensure hierarchical relationships between elements are preserved
Validate that all semantic emphasis (bold, italic, etc.) is maintained
Confirm that images, media, and other resources are properly referenced
Verify that the overall document structure and flow is preserved
