# How it works

1. Takes in a question or something to research about
2. This gets sent to find URLs
3. The URLs get openened and the html gets extracted (this happens for each URL)
4. The html turns into md (this happens for each URL)
5. The md gets interpreted (this happens for each URL)
6. The main topics to answer the question gets extracted (this happens for each URL)
7. The main topics gets sent to another agent to see if enough information was found to make a good report.
8. If yes, the topics, and question gets send to a writer agent.
9. Then this report gets sent to a curator agent, where it fact checks everything and points out any errors
10. The errors and report and question gets sent to an editor where the report is re-written with the changes
11. This report is the completed report.
